# Quiz: TDD and Functional Array Methods 

**Use standard lab submission procedure**

Write a **tested** (mocha unit test) library function (a function exported from a module) 
that takes an array of numbers (you can assume valid input)
and returns a new array that contains the square of the input numbers
filtered to only contain those squares greater than 20.

Input | Output
---|---
[1, 4, 5, 7] | [25, 49]

**NOTE: You are _not_ being asked to implement the array methods like we did on first lab**

Repo already includes:

* `.travis.yml`
* `.gitignore`
* `.eslintrc`

You will need to:
* create your `package.json`!
* install dev dependencies
* organize project
* create `scripts`
    * **please make sure _also_:**
        * npm i eslint -D
        * add `"pretest": "eslint ."

Quiz is open book, internet, etc...

**Goal is have PR with passing travis by end of allotted time.**

## Rules

1. **Make an initial commit when you start your work**
1. You have **25 minutes** to complete what you can. You may not finish everything 
(and don't need to do so to get a passing score). Do focus on quality of what you complete.
1. You must complete this work on your own within the allotted time
    * Keep a good commit history to show progression of work.
    * You **need to manage your time** to have PR and last commit before deadline (remember, you can
    open PR and take advantage of travis checking your commits by pushing frequently).
1. You may use normal resources that a software developer uses on the job (docs, google, your prior work)
1. You may install npm packages of your choosing
1. Use general best practices and common sense
    * Highly recommended to implement what is needed, no more no less
    * Blind boilerplate may not be helpful and will likely create more work
    * **Focus effort on requirements of the lab**
1. Total possible points are 40. You will be graded out of 30 points
1. Demonstrate what you can accomplish by having **passing travis ci** and showing working code.
